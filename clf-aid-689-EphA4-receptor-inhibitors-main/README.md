# Classification Activity of Inhibitors of EphA4 Receptor Antagonists (AID 689) with CatBoost 


*The EphA4 receptor(ephrin type-A receptor 4) plays a critical role  in the inhibition of axon regeneration that occurs after spinal cord injury. Besides ,there is a correlation between EphA4 and the neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).*


> The assay is based on the binding of EphA4 to a peptide (KYL peptide) that interacts with the high affinity ephrin-binding site of EphA4. The goal is to find small molecules that inhibit this interaction.[1]


# Results

- Matthews Correlation Coefficient(MCC) : 0.782315
